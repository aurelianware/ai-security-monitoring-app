CLINICAL ENCOUNTER NOTE

Encounter ID: ${input.encounterId}

SUBJECTIVE:
Patient reports discomfort in lower left molar, onset 3 days ago with progressive worsening.

OBJECTIVE:
Clinical examination pending. X-ray imaging recommended for definitive diagnosis.

ASSESSMENT:
Possible dental caries or pulpitis affecting tooth #19 (lower left second molar).

PLAN:
1. Perform comprehensive oral examination
2. Take periapical radiograph of affected area
3. Determine treatment based on findings
4. Discuss treatment options with patient

Next Steps:
- Schedule follow-up examination
- Radiographic imaging as needed
