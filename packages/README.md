This directory contains shared libraries and utilities.

## Future Packages

```
packages/
├── ui/            # Shared UI components
├── utils/         # Common utilities
├── types/         # Shared TypeScript types
├── config/        # Shared configuration
└── ml/            # Machine learning utilities
```

Each package should:
- Have its own `package.json`
- Be independently versioned
- Follow semantic versioning
- Have clear exports
- Include documentation
