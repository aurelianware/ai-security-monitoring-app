# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security Statement

This AI-powered security monitoring application is designed with security as a fundamental principle. As a home security application, we take the protection of user data and system integrity seriously.

## 🔒 Security Measures Implemented

### **Code Security**
- ✅ **Static Analysis**: CodeQL security scanning on every commit
- ✅ **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Strong typing prevents common security vulnerabilities
- ✅ **ESLint Security Rules**: Comprehensive security linting
- ✅ **Regular Updates**: Automated dependency updates via Dependabot

### **Application Security**
- ✅ **Client-Side Processing**: AI detection runs locally in browser
- ✅ **No Data Transmission**: Video/images never sent to external servers (unless cloud sync explicitly enabled)
- ✅ **Secure Storage**: IndexedDB with proper initialization and error handling
- ✅ **Permission-Based**: Requires explicit camera permission from user
- ✅ **HTTPS Only**: Secure communication protocols

### **Infrastructure Security**
- ✅ **Azure Integration**: Secure cloud storage with SAS token authentication
- ✅ **PWA Security**: Service workers with secure caching policies
- ✅ **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy implementation
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Proper sanitization of user inputs

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this application, please report it responsibly:

### **For Critical Security Issues**
- **Email**: [Create a private issue on GitHub or contact via profile]
- **Expected Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Disclosure Timeline**: 90 days coordinated disclosure

### **For Non-Critical Issues**
- **GitHub Issues**: Create a public issue with [SECURITY] tag
- **Pull Requests**: Submit fixes with detailed security impact description

## 🔍 Security Features by Component

### **Camera Stream Component**
- Secure camera access with proper permission handling
- No unauthorized data capture or transmission
- Proper cleanup of video streams and resources

### **AI Detection System**
- Local processing only (TensorFlow.js in browser)
- No model data sent to external services
- Secure handling of detection confidence scores

### **Storage System**
- Encrypted local storage using IndexedDB
- Secure blob handling for images/videos
- Proper database initialization to prevent race conditions

### **Cloud Sync (Optional)**
- SAS token authentication (no permanent keys stored)
- User-controlled opt-in for cloud features
- Secure upload/download with error handling
